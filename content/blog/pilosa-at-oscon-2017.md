Join us for the official launch of Pilosa at the [O'Reilly Open Source Convention](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx) in our home town of Austin, Texas!

<!--more-->

Our team of engineers will be at the Austin Convention Center on May 10th and 11th, and would love to talk all things open source. In particular, we’re eager to discuss how Pilosa—an open-source, distributed bitmap index that dramatically accelerates queries across multiple, massive data sets—can support the work of the broader open-source community. Find us at the following OSCON events:

### Presentation: The Index As a First-Class Citizen

We’d also advise you not to miss [a presentation by Matt Jaffee](/blog/oscon-2017-the-index-as-a-first-class-citizen/), our very own Lead “Slothware” Engineer. Titled [The Index As a First-Class Citizen](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/60565), Jaffee explores  what happens when you take the index out of the database and make it a separate application—one that is distributed, scalable, and takes full advantage of modern, multicore, high-memory hardware. Jaffee’s talk will be on Wednesday, May 10th at 11:00 AM in Meeting Room 13.

### Catch Us In the Expo Hall

If you can’t make Jaffee’s talk but are curious about Pilosa’s applications, members of our engineering team will be at Booth #532 in the Expo Hall on Tuesday and Wednesday. Feel free to stop by at any time, or hold out for the free food and local craft beers that will be at the booth from 5:45 PM to 7:00 PM as part of the official [OSCON Booth Crawl](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/57853). 

### Pilosa Launch Party

Last, and certainly not least, swing by our official Launch Party at [Sellers Underground](http://sellersaustin.com/) ([213 West 4th St.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sellers/@30.2664729,-97.747739,17z/)) at 7:00pm on Wednesday! Members of our team will be handing out tickets (good for two free drinks) all day Wednesday, so be sure to stop by our booth or flag down anyone wearing a Pilosa t-shirt!
