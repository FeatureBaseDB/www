In 2017, we [open-sourced](/blog/hello-world/) Pilosa with the goal of transforming the world of big data analytics using the power of bitmap indices and distributed computing. After two years of development, 38 releases, and tens of thousands of downloads, we couldn't be more proud of the work we've done.

Over that time, we've learned a few lessons. First, even as Pilosa is [easy to get started with](/docs/getting-started/), our users are busy professionals and are looking for a more turn-key solution that smoothly integrates with other data solutions. Second, many of our users are looking for innovative ways to add pluggable functionality into Pilosa. It became very clear to us that we could create a new developer experience that makes it easier to integrate with all data sources and empower data scientists with pluggable algorithms.

Today, we are launching [Molecula](https://www.molecula.com/), a data virtualization platform built around Pilosa. Molecula is not just a new brand. It's a new identity for us, and a suite of products that will make data instantly accessible to both humans and machines.

We are beyond excited for what we'll do with Molecula, but we aren't done with Pilosa. We are as committed as ever to improving and supporting Pilosa, with many new featuers in active development, including support for relational joins and an algorithm extension framework. The open source Pilosa will be the foundation on which will build Molecula. Please have a look at our [new website](https://www.molecula.com/)!
