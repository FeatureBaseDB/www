In this post, we will cover creating a Pilosa client library by going through the steps of writing one in Lua.

<!--more-->

### Introduction

The Pilosa server has a nice HTTP API which makes interaction with it a breeze. Essentially, a request with one or more [PQL (Pilosa Query Language)](https://www.pilosa.com/docs/latest/query-language/) queries is sent to the Pilosa server and one or more results are returned. A Pilosa client library makes it easier and less error prone to encode requests and decode responses.

[Lua](https://www.lua.org) is an embeddable scripting language which is very prevalent among game programmers due to its expressiveness, simplicity and ease of interoperability with C and C++. It is also supported by Nginx.

In this article, we are going to write a Pilosa client library in Lua. Although our sample library won't have all of the features of official client libraries, we will cover the fundamentals and have a base to improve upon. Even if you are not interested in creating a client library, you may find it useful to explore the sample client.

Before delving into client library design, let's have a quick glance at the current official libraries for Pilosa.

### Client Libraries Overview

Our primary target is UNIX-like platforms, but our clients run very well on Windows too. Currently we have three official client libraries written in Go, Python and Java.

* The Go client is at https://github.com/pilosa/go-pilosa. We support Go 1.8 and up.

* Our Java client is at https://github.com/pilosa/java-pilosa. Java 7 and up is supported. We use Maven as our build and packaging system, so it is available to most JVM based projects and languages like Scala, Clojure and Kotlin.

* The Python client is at https://github.com/pilosa/python-pilosa and supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 and up. The Python client library is also available on [PYPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi).

### Getting Ready

For the purposes of this post, we will assume you're on a UNIX-like platform such as Linux, MacOS or using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about). If you are on another platform, adapt the instructions to your particular platform.

Throughout this article, we will need to run queries against the Pilosa server, so let's go ahead and launch a new Pilosa server instance. We provide [precompiled binaries](https://github.com/pilosa/pilosa/releases) for MacOS and Linux (works on WSL too), a [Homebrew package](http://brewformulas.org/Pilosa) for MacOS and a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pilosa/pilosa/). See our documentation on [acquiring and installing Pilosa](https://www.pilosa.com/docs/latest/installation/) and [starting Pilosa](https://www.pilosa.com/docs/latest/getting-started/#starting-pilosa) if you need help installing Pilosa. We'll assume Pilosa is running on the default address with the default scheme at `http://localhost:10101`.

While writing the new client library, we will need to run requests against Pilosa and analyze the responses. [curl](https://curl.haxx.se) is probably the most popular tool for calling HTTP endpoints. It is usually preinstalled (or easily installable) in many UNIX-like platforms. Let's confirm that Pilosa is running and curl is installed. In a terminal, execute the following:
```
curl http://localhost:10101/version
```

We should get a response similar to the following:
```
{"version":"v0.7.1"}
```

If you get the `localhost port 10101: Connection refused` error, make sure Pilosa is running on the default address.

Since we are going to write our client library in [Lua](https://www.lua.org) we need to install Lua. But which version? When it comes to versioning, Lua takes a different stance than many mainstream languages, and the latest main release may not be compatible with earlier main releases. Version 5.1 seems to be the most supported version in the Lua community so we will target it for this client library.

Although Lua 5.1 is available with most package managers for UNIX-like platforms and it's easy to compile, it's most convenient to use the Python based [Hererocks](https://github.com/mpeterv/hererocks) script to install it. Hererocks requires a compiler to compile Lua, so install one if you didn't already do so. Clang for MacOS, Visual Studio for Windows, and GCC for Linux, WSL and other UNIX-like platforms works great. The following command creates a Lua 5.1 virtual environment with the latest LuaRocks and activates it:
```
python hererocks.py lua5.1 -l5.1 -rlatest
source lua5.1/bin/activate
```

Run `lua -v` to confirm that the virtual environment was created with the correct Lua version.

[LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org) is the defacto package manager for Lua. We are going to use it to install dependencies of our example client library. If you are using Hererocks then LuaRocks will already be installed in your virtual environment, otherwise make sure to install it.

Let's install the dependencies for our client library:
```
luarocks install luasocket
luarocks install busted
luarocks install luacov
```

LuaSocket provides the internal HTTP client we are going to use in our library. There are other, more advanced HTTP libraries for Lua, but their Windows support is not as good. Busted is a popular testing framework. It can use Luacov for generating a test coverage report.

The final project is at the [Lua Client repository](https://github.com/pilosa/lua-pilosa). We are going to use the following layout for our client library project:
```
lua-pilosa/
    pilosa/
    integration-tests/
    tests/
    .travis.yml
    LICENSE
    Makefile
    README.md
    make.cmd
    pilosa-0.1.0-1.rockspec
```

We use the `LANGUAGE-pilosa` convention when naming client libraries at Pilosa. The library code is in the `pilosa` directory, unit tests are in `tests` and integration tests are (predictably) in `integration-tests`. `pilosa-0.1.0-1.rockspec` is the package definition file for LuaRocks. `.travis.yml` is the confiration file for Travis CI.

#### Creating a Makefile
 
It's convenient to be able to use the same commands to execute tasks for all client libraries. All official Pilosa client library projects use a `Makefile` (or its Windows equivalent `make.cmd`) which has the same targets to accomplish the same task.

We are going to create a trivial `Makefile` for our client library with the following targets:

- `test`: Runs unit tests.
- `test-all`: Runs both unit tests and integration tests.
- `cover`: Runs all tests with coverage.

```Makefile
.PHONY: cover test test-all

test:
	busted tests

test-all:
	busted tests integration-tests

cover: luacov.report.out
	cat luacov.report.out

luacov.report.out: luacov.stats.out
	busted --coverage tests integration-tests
```

You can see the equivalent `make.cmd` [here](https://github.com/pilosa/lua-pilosa/blob/master/make.cmd).

We won't use any other targets for this client, but official Pilosa clients make use of the following extra targets:
- `generate`: Creates the protobuf encoder/decoder from definition files.
- `release`: Uploads the client library to the corresponding package manager.
- `doc`: Creates the documentation.
- `build`: Builds the client library.

#### A Note on Class Definitions

Although we design our client library around *classes*, Lua doesn't have the concept of a *class*. Instead, it emulates object orientation through the use of *metatables* and some syntactic sugar.

For example, we would define the `Schema` *class* as follows:
```lua
function Schema.new()
    local self = setmetatable({}, Schema)
    self.indexes = {}
    return self
end

function Schema:index(name)
    return Index(name)
end

-- Create a Schema instance
local schema = Schema.new()
-- Note that we use a column instead of a dot.
-- This is equivalent to: local myIndex = schema.index(schema, "my-index")
local myIndex = schema:index("my-index")
```

How to create a class is not obvious unless you are a Lua programmer, so we use the *Lua Classic* module in `pilosa/classic.lua` to make our classes more familiar. The `Schema` class can be re-defined as:
```lua
local Object = require "pilosa.classic"
local Schema = Object:extend()

function Schema:new()
    self.indexes = {}
end

function Schema:index(name)
    return Index(name)
end

-- We don't call new() explicitly anymore
local schema = Schema()
local myIndex = schema:index("my-index"
```

### ORM

The ORM component provides an API to form PQL (Pilosa Query Language) queries. The advantage of using the ORM against raw queries is that it is usually less verbose and less error prone. Also, parameters are validated on the client side which allows us to catch validation related errors earlier.

We are going put the ORM related code in `pilosa/orm.lua`. Let's start with defining `PQLQuery` which contains a PQL query as well as the index that the query is to be executed against. `PQLQuery` constructor receives the `index` of type `Index` (to be defined a bit further) and `pql` of type string:


```lua
function PQLQuery:new(index, pql)
    self.pql = pql
    self.index = index
end

function PQLQuery:serialize()
    return self.pql
end
```

The user is not supposed to create `PQLQuery` instances directly. Instead the `Index` class is going to have helper methods to create them.

The `serialize` method returns the query as a string.

Pilosa supports many queries in the same request, which cuts down the number of HTTP calls and improves throughput. Let's create the slightly more advanced `PQLBatchQuery` class which keeps one or more PQL statements. `PQLBatchQuery` implements the same interface as `PQLQuery`, so it is usable anywhere a `PQLQuery` is expected:

```lua
function PQLBatchQuery:new(index, ...)
    local queries = {}
    for i, v in ipairs(arg) do
        table.insert(queries, v:serialize())
    end
    self.queries = queries
end

function PQLBatchQuery:add(query)
    table.insert(self.queries, query:serialize())
end

function PQLBatchQuery:serialize()
    -- concatenate serialized queries as a string
    return table.concat(self.queries)
end
```

The ORM hierarchy starts with the `Schema` class, which is used to create and cache `Index` objects:

```lua
function Schema:new()
    self.indexes = {}
end

function Schema:index(name)
    index = self.indexes[name]
    if index == nil then
        index = Index(name)
        self.indexes[name] = index
    end
    return index
end
```

A `Schema` object can be instantiated directly, but usually the user loads the schema from the Pilosa server:
```lua
-- create a schema
local schema1 = Schema()
-- load a schema
local schema2 = client.schema()
```

Once the user has a `Schema` object she can create `Index` instances. Note that the changes in the ORM side aren't persisted until the user explicitly synchronizes the schema with the Pilosa server using `client.syncSchema(schema)`.

Let's define the `Index` class:

```lua
function Index:new(name)
    validator.ensureValidIndexName(name)
    self.name = name
    -- frames is a weak table
    self.frames = {}
    setmetatable(self.frames, { __mode = "v" })
end

function Index:frame(name, options)
    local frame = self.frames[name]
    if frame == nil then
        frame = Frame(self, name, options)
        self.frames[name] = frame
    end
    return frame
end
```

The `Index` object keeps a cache of frames. The `frame` method creates a new `Frame` object or returns an already existing `Frame` object. We should be careful when caching `Frame` objects, since `Frame` objects have to keep a reference to their parent `Index` object. This creates a circular reference and that can be problematic for languages with a reference counting memory management scheme.

Let's add a few methods to `Index`:

```lua
function Index:rawQuery(query)
    return PQLQuery(self, query)
end

function Index:batchQuery(...)
    return PQLBatchQuery(self, unpack(arg))
end

function Index:union(...)
    return bitmapOp(self, "Union", unpack(arg))
end

-- ... SNIP ... --

function bitmapOp(index, name, ...)
    local serializedArgs = {}
    for i, a in ipairs(arg) do
        table.insert(serializedArgs, a:serialize())
    end
    local pql = string.format("%s(%s)", name, table.concat(serializedArgs, ", "))
    return PQLQuery(index, pql)
end
```

`rawQuery` allows the user to send any string to the Pilosa server as a query and `batchQuery` creates a `PQLBatchQuery` object with the given queries passed as arguments.

`union` method creates a `Union` query with the given bitmap queries. It calls the `bitmapOp` helper function to create the query. `intersect`, `difference` and `xor` methods are defined similarly.

Next up, the `Frame` class:
```lua
function Frame:new(index, name, options)
    validator.ensureValidFrameName(name)
    self.index = index
    self.name = name
    options = options or {}
    self.options = {
        timeQuantum = options.timeQuantum or TimeQuantum.NONE,
        inverseEnabled = options.inverseEnabled or false,
        cacheType = options.cacheType or CacheType.DEFAULT,
        cacheSize = options.cacheSize or 0
    }
end
```

`TimeQuantum` and `CacheType` contain string values accepted by the Pilosa server:
```lua
local TimeQuantum = {
    NONE = "",
    YEAR = "Y",
    MONTH = "M",
    DAY = "D",
    HOUR = "H",
    YEAR_MONTH = "YM",
    MONTH_DAY = "MD",
    DAY_HOUR = "DH",
    YEAR_MONTH_DAY = "YMD",
    MONTH_DAY_HOUR = "MDH",
    YEAR_MONTH_DAY_HOUR = "YMDH"
}

local CacheType = {
    DEFAULT = "",
    LRU = "lru",
    RANKED = "ranked"
}
```

The Frame constructor stores the frame's name, its parent index, and any available frame options. Next, a few methods which implement queries that work on frames:
```lua
function Frame:bitmap(rowID)
    local query = string.format("Bitmap(rowID=%d, frame='%s')", rowID, self.name)
    return PQLQuery(self.index, query)
end

function Frame:setbit(rowID, columnID, timestamp)
    local ts = ""
    if timestamp ~= nil then
        ts = string.format(", timestamp='%s'", os.date(TIME_FORMAT, timestamp))
    end
    local query = string.format("SetBit(rowID=%d, frame='%s', columnID=%d%s)", rowID, self.name, columnID, ts)
    return PQLQuery(self.index, query)
end

function Frame:inverseBitmap(columnID)
    local query = string.format("Bitmap(columnID=%d, frame='%s')", columnID, self.name)
    return PQLQuery(self.index, query)
end
```

Let's give a try our ORM classes. We define the schema first:
```lua
local schema = Schema()
local index1 = schema:index("index1")
local frame1 = myIndex:frame("frame1")
```

 Below is the code which creates the equivalent of the PQL query `Intersect(Bitmap(frame="frame1", rowID=10), Bitmap(frame="frame1", columnID=20))`:
```lua
local query = index1:intersect(frame1:bitmap(10), frame1:bitmap(20))
```

Pretty straightforward. You can check out the rest of [pilosa/orm.lua](https://github.com/pilosa/lua-pilosa/blob/master/pilosa/orm.lua) file [here](https://github.com/pilosa/lua-pilosa/blob/master/pilosa/orm.lua).


### Client

A Pilosa URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) represents the address of a Pilosa node. It consists of three parts: scheme, host and port. `https://index2.pilosa.com:10501` is a sample URI which points to the Pilosa node running at host `index2.pilosa.com` port `10501` and which uses the `https` scheme. All parts of a Pilosa URI are optional, but at least one of the parts should be specified. The following URIs are equivalent:

- `http://localhost:10101`
- `http://localhost`
- `http://:10101`
- `localhost:10101`
- `localhost`
- `:10101`

The Lua code below defines the `URI` class which keeps a Pilosa URI. It lets us write `https://index2.pilosa.com:10501` as `URI("https", "index2.pilosa.com", 10501)`:

```lua
local DEFAULT_SCHEME = "http"
local DEFAULT_HOST = "localhost"
local DEFAULT_PORT = 10101

function URI:new(scheme, host, port)
    self.scheme = scheme
    self.host = host
    self.port = port
end

function URI:default()
    return URI(DEFAULT_SCHEME, DEFAULT_HOST, DEFAULT_PORT)
end
```

Generally, it is much more convenient to use a Pilosa URI as is. We can easily parse a string address and convert it to a Pilosa URI:
```lua
function URI:address(address)
    scheme, host, port = parseAddress(address)
    return URI(scheme, host, port)
end
```

The following regular expression captures all parts of a valid Pilosa URI and is used in all official client libraries:
```
^(([+a-z]+)://)?([0-9a-z.-]+)?(:([0-9]+))?$
```

Unfortunately Lua's regular expressions support is not as powerful to capture all groups in that regular expression, so each combination of URI parts should be checked separately. Below are regular expressions which should be checked from top to bottom until a match is found:
```lua
local PATTERN_SCHEME_HOST_PORT = "^([+a-z]+)://([0-9a-z.-]+):([0-9]+)$"
local PATTERN_SCHEME_HOST = "^([+a-z]+)://([0-9a-z.-]+)$"
local PATTERN_SCHEME_PORT = "^([+a-z]+)://:([0-9]+)$"
local PATTERN_HOST_PORT = "^([0-9a-z.-]+):([0-9]+)$"
local PATTERN_SCHEME = "^([+a-z]+)://$"
local PATTERN_PORT = "^:([0-9]+)$"
local PATTERN_HOST = "^([0-9a-z.-]+)$"
```

With those regular expressions defined, we can code `parseAddress` as follows:
```lua
function parseAddress(address)
    scheme, host, port = string.match(address, PATTERN_SCHEME_HOST_PORT)
    if scheme ~= nil and host ~= nil and port ~= nil then
        return scheme, host, tonumber(port)
    end
    
    scheme, host = string.match(address, PATTERN_SCHEME_HOST)
    if scheme ~= nil and host ~= nil then
        return scheme, host, DEFAULT_PORT
    end

    -- ... SNIP ... --

    host = string.match(address, PATTERN_HOST)
    if host ~= nil then
        return DEFAULT_SCHEME, host, DEFAULT_PORT
    end

    error("Not a Pilosa URI")    
end
```

Lastly, we want to convert a `URI` to a string in a format to be passed to the internal HTTP client. We call that method `normalize`:
```lua
function URI:normalize()
    return string.format("%s://%s:%d", self.scheme, self.host, self.port)
end
```

Pilosa server supports HTTP requests with JSON or [protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf) payload for querying, and HTTP requests with JSON payload for other endpoints. It is usually more efficient to encode/decode protobuf payloads but JSON support is more prevalent. Although  all of Pilosa's official client libraries use protobuf payloads for querying,  we will use JSON payloads for this client library.

`Content-Type` and `Accept` are two HTTP headers which tell the Pilosa server the type of the payload for requests and responses respectively. Most of the endpoints of Pilosa server don't require explicitly setting those endpoints and default to `application/json` but we are going to set them anyway in case the default changes in a future release.

Let's create the `PilosaClient` class:
```lua
function PilosaClient:new(uri, options)
    self.uri = uri or URI:default()
    self.options = options or {}
end
```

Most Pilosa clients can be initialized with a Pilosa URI or URIs of a cluster. But to keep things a bit simpler, we are going to assign a single URI to the client. If the user doesn't supply a URI or options, we simply use the defaults.

The actual request to a Pilosa server is not accomplished by the `PilosaClient` itself, but rather by an underlying HTTP library which we'll refer to as the internal HTTP client. The internal client library we use for this project doesn't support advanced features such as connection pooling.

Let's write a generic method to call Pilosa which we are going to use shortly:

```lua
function httpRequest(client, method, path, data)
    data = data or ""
    local url = string.format("%s%s", client.uri:normalize(), path)
    local chunks = {}

    local r, status = http.request{
        url=url,
        method=method,
        source=ltn12.source.string(data),
        sink=ltn12.sink.table(chunks),
        headers=getHeaders(data)
    }

    if r == nil then
        -- status contains the error string
        error({error=status, code=0})
    end

    local response = table.concat(chunks)

    if status < 200 or status >= 300 then
        error({error=response, code=status})
    end

    return response
end
```

The `httpRequest` function receives a `PilosaClient` object, and the method, path and optionally the data for a request. It returns a string response. LuaSocket has the concept of sources and sinks. `http.request` function reads from a source and saves the response to the sink in chunks. We build the response by concatenating those chunks.

`getHeaders` function is trivially defined as follows:
```lua
function getHeaders(data)
    return {
        -- Content Length is the size of the data
        ["content-length"] = #data,
        ["content-type"] = "application/json",
        ["accept"] = "application/json"
    }
end
```

All Pilosa queries require specifying an index, so let's try to create one with default options using `curl`:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:10101/index/sample-index -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -d ''
```

Outputs `{}` which indicates that the index was created successfully. If you run the command above again, you will get the `index already exists` error with the `409 Conflict` status.

Using the `httpRequest` function we defined above, we can define the `createIndex` method of the `PilosaClient`:
```lua
function PilosaClient:createIndex(index)
    local path = string.format("/index/%s", index.name)
    httpRequest(self, "POST", path, "{}")
end
```

This method just encodes index options as the payload and creates the HTTP path using the index name.

When `createIndex` method is called with an index, it will create the index on the server side if it doesn't already exist. If it does exist, it will raise an error. It would be convenient to have a method which would be more forgiving when trying to create an existing index. Let's call that method `ensureIndex`:
```lua
local HTTP_CONFLICT = 409

function PilosaClient:ensureIndex(index)
    local response, err = pcall(function() self:createIndex(index) end)
    if err ~= nil and err.code ~= HTTP_CONFLICT then
        error(err)
    end
end
```

Frames can have options attached to them, so `createFrame` has to POST those options in the request body: `{"options": { ... }}`. `createFrame` is defined as follows:
```lua
function PilosaClient:createFrame(frame)
    local data = {options = frame.options}
    local path = string.format("/index/%s/frame/%s", frame.index.name, frame.name)
    httpRequest(self, "POST", path, json.encode(data))
end
```

The most important method of our `PilosaClient` class is `query`, which serializes the ORM query we pass and returns a response. It is defined below:
```lua
local QueryResponse = require "pilosa.response".QueryResponse

function PilosaClient:query(query, options)
    options = QueryOptions(options)
    local data = query:serialize()
    local path = string.format("/index/%s/query%s", query.index.name, options:encode())
    local response = httpRequest(self, "POST", path, data)
    return QueryResponse(response)
end
```

The `query` method can optionally take a few query options. The user would pass those query options as a table, and we convert it to a `QueryOptions` object which is defined below:
```lua
function QueryOptions:new(options)
    options = options or {}
    self.options = {
        columnAttrs = options.columnAttributes == true,
        excludeAttrs = options.excludeAttributes == true,
        excludeBits = options.excludeBits == true
    }
end
```

With the `PilosaClient` class defined, the user can run queries similar to the following:
```lua
local query = myFrame:bitmap(10)
local client = PilosaClient(URI:default())
local response = client:query(query, {excludeAttributes = true})
```

The rest of [pilosa/client.lua](https://github.com/pilosa/lua-pilosa/blob/master/pilosa/client.lua) is [here](https://github.com/pilosa/lua-pilosa/blob/master/pilosa/client.lua).

### Response

The response from the Pilosa server for a query request may be in JSON or protobuf, depending on the `Accept` header in the HTTP request. The number of results in the response is the same as the number of PQL statements in the query request. Results in a response encoded in protobuf have the same structure with different values for fields. On the other hand, for JSON responses, the structure of a result depends on the corresponding PQL query.

Since we opted for the JSON payloads for queries, let's try a few queries using `curl` and check the responses.

We need to create the index and frame first:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:10101/index/test-index -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -d ''
curl -X POST http://localhost:10101/index/test-index/frame/test-frame -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -d '{"options":{"inverseEnabled":true}}'
```

Let's see what we get back for the `SetBit` query:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:10101/index/test-index/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -d 'SetBit(frame="test-frame",rowID=5, columnID=100)'
```

Outputs: `{"results":[true]}`. `SetBit` and `ClearBit` returns a boolean value, representing whether a bit was set or cleared.

Now the `SetRowAttrs` query:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:10101/index/test-index/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -d 'SetRowAttrs(frame="test-frame",rowID=5, attr1=1, attr2="foo", attr3=true)'
```

Outputs: `{"results":[null]}`. `SetRowAttrs` and `SetColumnAttrs` always return `null`.

How about the `Bitmap` query?
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:10101/index/test-index/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -d 'Bitmap(frame="test-frame",rowID=5)'
```

Outputs: `{"results":[{"attrs":{"attr1":1,"attr2":"foo","attr3":true},"bits":[100]}]}`. The result for a `Bitmap` query includes the `attrs` map if there are any attributes set for the specified row, and the `bits` array which contains the columns for the row.

Let's try a `TopN` query:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:10101/index/test-index/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -d 'TopN(frame="test-frame")'
```

Outputs: `{"results":[[{"id":5,"count":1}]]}`. The result is a list of count result items composed of a rowID and the count of bits set.

Next up, the `Count` query:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:10101/index/test-index/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -d 'Count(Bitmap(frame="test-frame",rowID=5))'
```

Outputs: `{"results":[1]}`, which is the number of bits set for the given row.

Let's define the `QueryResponse` class in `pilosa/response.lua`:
```lua
function QueryResponse:new(response)
    local jsonResponse = json.decode(response)
    local results = {}
    if jsonResponse["results"] ~= nil then
        for i, result in ipairs(jsonResponse["results"]) do
            table.insert(results, QueryResult(result))
        end
    end
    self.results = results
    self.result = results[1]
end
```

The constructor of `QueryResponse` receives a string response and decodes it. It then extracts the results and stores them in the `results` property. It is convenient to access a result directly when it is the only one. So we set the `result` property as the first result.

As we have seen above, a result may contain different fields depending on the corresponding query. `QueryResult` class consolidates those fields in a single data structure. Unset fields have a default value.
```lua
function QueryResult:new(result)
    -- SetBit and ClearBit returns boolean values. We currently do not store them in the response.
    if result == true then
        result = {}
    else
        result = result or {}
    end
    -- Queries such as Bitmap, Union, etc. return bitmap results
    self.bitmap = BitmapResult(result)
    -- Count and Sum queries return the count
    self.count = result.count or 0
    -- Sum query returns the sum
    self.sum = result.sum or 0
    -- TopN returns a list of (ID, count) pairs. We call each of them count result item.
    local countItems = {}
    if #result > 0 and result[1].id ~= nil and result[1].count ~= nil then
        for i, item in ipairs(result) do
            table.insert(countItems, CountResultItem(item))
        end
    end
    self.countItems = countItems
end
```

Queries such as Bitmap, Union, etc. return bitmap results. A bitmap result contains the bits set for the corresponding row or column and the attributes.
```lua
function BitmapResult:new(result)
    self.bits = result.bits or {}
    self.attributes = result.attrs or {}
end
```

`TopN` queries return a list of (ID, count) pairs. We call each of them a count result item. The `CountResultItem` is defined below:
```lua
function CountResultItem:new(id, count)
    self.id = id
    self.count = count
end
```

Here's how our users would retrieve results from a response:
```lua
local query = myFrame:bitmap(10)
local client = PilosaClient(URI:default())
local response = client:query(query)

for i, result in ipairs(response.results) do
    print(string.format("There are %d bits in result %d", #result.bitmap.bits, i))
end

local bitmapResult = response.result.bitmap
```

Rest of [pilosa/response.lua](https://github.com/pilosa/lua-pilosa/blob/master/pilosa/response.lua) is [here](https://github.com/pilosa/lua-pilosa/blob/master/pilosa/response.lua).

### Testing

It's a good idea to separate unit tests from integration tests since integration tests depend on a running Pilosa server, and may take longer to complete. Our `Makefile` contains two targets for testing, `make test` runs unit tests and `make test-all` runs both unit and integration tests.

Integration tests require the Pilosa server to be running on the default address, but you can change it using the `PILOSA_BIND` environment variable.
```lua
function getClient()
    local serverAddress = os.getenv("PILOSA_BIND")
    if serverAddress == nil then
        serverAddress = "http://localhost:10101"
    end
    return PilosaClient(URI:address(serverAddress))
end
```

Below is a part of the `PilosaClient` test case. Note that we create the necessary index and frame in the setup function `before_each` and delete the index (which deletes the frame too) in the teardown function `after_each`. `before_each` and `after_each` runs before and after each test function respectively.

```lua
describe("PilosaClient", function()
    local client = getClient()
    local schema = orm.Schema()
    local index = schema:index("test-index")
    local frame = index:frame("test-frame")

    before_each(function()
        client:ensureIndex(index)
        client:ensureFrame(frame)
    end)

    after_each(function()
        client:deleteIndex(index)
    end)

    -- Tests are here --
end)
```

And here is the test function for `PilosaClient:query`:
```lua
    it("can send a query", function()
        local client = getClient()
        client:query(frame:setbit(10, 20))        
        local response1 = client:query(frame:bitmap(10))
        local bitmap = response1.result.bitmap
        assert.equals(0, #bitmap.attributes)
        assert.equals(1, table.getn(bitmap.bits))
        assert.same(20, bitmap.bits[1])
    end)
```

All official Pilosa clients have the same structure and similarly named classes and methods. That makes it easy to port tests between client libraries.

### Continuous Integration

Finally we have a basic Lua client library for Pilosa, together with tests. It would be nice if the tests were run automatically when the code changed using a continuous integration service.

We use Github and Travis CI for our continuous integration infrastructure for our  projects at Pilosa. We provide a precompiled Pilosa binary which tracks the latest master so we can be sure that our client libraries work with the latest Pilosa server.

Travis CI doesn't directly support Lua, but we can use their Python image and install Lua using HereRocks like we have done in the Getting Started section. Below is the `.travis.yml` we use for this project:

```yaml
language: python
python:
  - "2.7"
before_install:
  - wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/build.pilosa.com/pilosa-master-linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar xf pilosa-master-linux-amd64.tar.gz
  - ./pilosa-master-linux-amd64/pilosa server -d http_data &
  - curl -O https://github.com/mpeterv/hererocks/raw/0.17.0/hererocks.py
  - python hererocks.py lua5.1 -l5.1 -rlatest
  - source lua5.1/bin/activate
install:
  - luarocks install luasocket busted
script:
  - make test-all
```

### Conclusion

In this article we explored the fundamentals of writing a client library for Pilosa and wrote a simple one in Lua. Hopefully this article has been useful for those of you interested in writing your own Pilosa client library, or even those just looking to better understand the current client libraries.

We're always looking for feedback, so feel free to reach out if you think there's something we missed, or other topics you'd like us to cover.
