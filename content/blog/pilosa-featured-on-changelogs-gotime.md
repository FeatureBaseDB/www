Since we write in Go all day, everyday, we LOVE Changelog’s GoTime Podcast. The show consists of a panel of Go experts and special guests discussing the Go programming language, the Go community, and everything in between.

Pilosa’s very own Matt Jaffee was featured on GoTime last week to talk all things Go: distributed systems, indexing tools, cool Go projects, and more. Matt is our lead software engineer and a Go enthusiast. 

Check out his episode below to hear why Go is the perfect language for designing simple, high performance, distributed systems like Pilosa:
