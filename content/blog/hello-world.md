We are Pilosa, order of the sloth. We make slothware.

Our slumber (which is what some call a group of sloths) has created a distributed bitmap index that sits on top of data stores and dramatically accelerates query speed across multiple, massive data sets.

Today we are open-sourcing our work under the Apache License, version 2.0, and we hope that you will join us on this journey.

Why did we create Pilosa? Because the rate that information can be read from storage has not kept pace with the exponential growth that we've seen in both compute capacity and data volume. Realizing this, we wanted to provide a better way to query, and gain insights from, our ever-growing data stores without being constrained by the time it takes to read all of that data.

The Pilosa index helps big data seem smaller by representing the underlying data and its relationships as binary values. Unlike the indexes typically found in database systems, which are tightly coupled to and dependent upon the storage engine, Pilosa is independent of storage—a first class citizen in the data stack.

When we set out to build Pilosa, our goal was to create something that would allow scientists to ask questions of all their data in real-time, no matter how large the data set. With Pilosa, I think we've done just that. I'm proud of what we've built so far, and I'm excited to see what we—and the Pilosa community—will build in the days to come!

While we sloths and our superorder Xenartha began evolving 60 million years ago, Pilosa the company was founded in 2017 with a commitment to building community-driven, open-source software that unlocks the full power of data science.
