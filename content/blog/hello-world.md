We are Pilosa, order of the sloth. We make slothware.

Our slumber, which is what some call a group of sloths, has created a distributed bitmap index that sits on top of data stores and dramatically accelerates query speed across multiple, massive data sets.

Today we are open sourcing the project under the Apache License, version 2.0, and we hope that you will join us on this journey.

Why did we create Pilosa? Whereas both compute capacity and data volume are growing exponentially, the rate at which information can be read has not kept pace.

The Pilosa index helps big data act much smaller by representing everything as a 1 or 0. It is independent of storage, a first class citizen. 

We optimized it for high cardinality data at scale so that scientists can ask questions of all their data in real-time, no matter how large the job.

While sloths and our superorder Xenartha began evolving 60 million years ago in South America, Pilosa the company was founded in 2017 with a commitment to building community-driven, open source software that unlocks the full power of data science.
