We are an open source project and want to keep this as simple as possible for the Pilosa community.

#### License

The Pilosa Community Edition is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, which allows you a lot of room to mod and / or ship something based off of Pilosa Community Edition. Pilosa Enterprise Edition is licensed separately; [contact us](/about/#contact) for more details. We have developed this [license FAQ](/legal/license-faq/) in case you want to dive deeper.

#### Contributor License Agreement

In order to protect both you and the Pilosa project, when you contribute we ask you to sign a CLA (contributor license agreement). You can do this through CLA Assistant at [this link](https://cla-assistant.io/pilosa/pilosa).  Check out [this great explanation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/) that the Django Software Foundation wrote as to why they have a CLA.  In the event you are contributing through your workplace, we have a custom CLA that you can [contact us](/about/#contact) about.

#### Trademark

Trademarks are a little different than software licenses.  Read the actual policy here, but here is the gist of it.  If you want to use our name or logo when, for example, hosting a meetup, that's great. You might call it something like "Pilosa Meetup." And you might want to make a new product out of Pilosa, that's awesome too. The Apache 2.0 license allows for all of this, and we encourage it! But in this case, from a trademark perspective, you would not want to throw just our logo on it and just call it "Pilosa." Again, read more here if you want to figure out the difference.
