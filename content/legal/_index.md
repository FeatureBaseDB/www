We operate both an open source project (Pilosa Community Edition) and a commercial software license (Pilosa Enterprise Edition). Our goal is to keep the legal provisioning of Pilosa as simple as possible for both our community and our enterprise customers.

### Apache License, Version 2.0

The Pilosa Community Edition is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), which allows you a lot of room to mod and / or ship something based off of the Pilosa Community Edition. If you have any questions about the Pilosa Community Edition or the Apache License, Version 2.0, please [contact us](/about/#contact).

### Contributor License Agreement

In order to protect both you and the Pilosa project, when you contribute we ask you to sign a CLA (contributor license agreement). You can do this through CLA Assistant at [this link](https://cla-assistant.io/pilosa/pilosa).  Check out [this great explanation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/) that the Django Software Foundation wrote as to why they have a CLA.  In the event you are contributing through your workplace, we have a custom CLA that you can [contact us](/about/#contact) about.

### Enterprise License Agreement

The Pilosa Enterprise Edition is governed by our [Enterprise Software and Support Terms and Conditions](/legal/enterprise-license/) (“Enterprise License Agreement”) along with related customer Orders. If you have any questions about the Pilosa Enterprise Edition or the Enterprise License Agreement, please [contact us](/about/#contact).

### Trademark

Trademarks are a little different than software licenses.  [Read the actual policy here](/legal/trademark/), but here is the gist of it.  If you want to use our name or logo when, for example, hosting a meetup, that's great. You might call it something like "Pilosa Meetup." If you ship a product that uses Pilosa, from a trademark perspective, you would not want use just the Pilosa logo and  "Pilosa" name; you can refer to us though. Again, [read the official policy here](/legal/trademark/) if you want to tease out when it's ok to use the Pilosa name and logos.
