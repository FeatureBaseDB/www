Pilosa makes no warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory regarding or relating to the Software or the Documentation, or any materials or services furnished or provided to Customer under this Agreement, including Maintenance and Support.  PILOSA HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION AND SAID OTHER MATERIALS AND SERVICES, AND WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING.  

**7.2. Limitation of Liability.**  EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF SECTION 8, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THE FURNISHING, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES PERFORMED HEREUNDER, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF SECTION 8, EACH PARTY’S LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR DAMAGES WILL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED THE LICENSE FEE PAID BY CUSTOMER TO PILOSA UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.  The provisions of this Section 7 allocate risks under this Agreement between Customer and Pilosa.  Pilosa’s pricing of the Software reflects this allocation of risks and limitation of liability.

Customer shall give prompt written notice to Pilosa of any such claim, action or allegation of infringement and give Pilosa the authority to proceed as contemplated herein.  Pilosa will have the exclusive right to defend any such claim, action or allegation and make settlements thereof at its own discretion, and Customer may not settle or compromise such claim, action or allegation, except with prior written consent of Pilosa.  Customer shall give such assistance and information as Pilosa may reasonably require to settle or oppose such claims.  Customer may participate in such defense with counsel of its own choice, at its own expense.

**8.2. Indemnification by Customer.**  Subject to Pilosa’s obligations under Section 8.1, Customer shall, at its expense, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Pilosa and its affiliates, directors, agents, and users, against any third party claims, actions and demands brought against Pilosa or Pilosa’s affiliates, directors, agents, and users.  Customer shall pay all damages, if any, finally awarded against Pilosa indemnified parties or agreed upon in settlement by Customer (including other reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Pilosa, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, in connection with enforcing this Section 8.2) arising from: (i) Customer’s breach or violation of Customer’s responsibilities under Sections 3.2, 4, or 5, (ii) claims that Customer Data or use thereof in the Software infringes or violates the rights of a third party, or (iii) claims that Customer’s or its affiliates, directors, agents, and Users use of the Software or services in violation of this Agreement infringes or violates the rights of such third party.

**8.3. Options.**  In the event any such infringement, claim, action or allegation is brought or threatened accusing the Software, Pilosa shall, at its sole option and expense:

8.3.1.	procure for Customer the right to continue use of the Software or infringing part thereof; 

8.3.2.	modify or amend the Software or infringing part thereof, or replace the Software or infringing part thereof with other software having substantially the same or better capabilities, or, if neither of the foregoing is commercially practicable; or

8.3.3.	terminate this Agreement and repay to Customer all amounts paid by Customer hereunder.

**8.4. Exclusions.**  Pilosa’s obligations under this Section 8 will not apply to the extent the infringement arises as a result of modifications to the Software made by any party other than Pilosa or Pilosa’s authorized representative.

Information communicated orally will be considered Confidential Information if such information is confirmed in writing as being Confidential Information within a reasonable time after the initial disclosure.  Confidential Information may also include information disclosed to a disclosing party by third parties.  Confidential Information will not, however, include any information which (a) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by the disclosing party, (b) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by the disclosing party to the receiving party through no action or inaction of the receiving party, (c) is already in the possession of the receiving party at the time of disclosure by the disclosing party as shown by the receiving party’s files and records immediately prior to the time of disclosure, (d) is obtained by the receiving party from a third party without a breach of such third party’s obligations of confidentiality, (e) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, as shown by documents and other competent evidence in the receiving party’s possession, or (f) is required by law to be disclosed by the receiving party, provided that the receiving party gives the disclosing party prompt written notice of such requirement prior to such disclosure and assistance in obtaining an order protecting the information from public disclosure.  

**9.2. Non-Use and Non-Disclosure.**  Each party agrees not to use any Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose except to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under this Agreement.  Each party agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information of the other party to third parties or to such party’s employees, except to those employees of the receiving party with a need to know.  

**9.3. Maintenance of Confidentiality.**  Each party agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other party.  Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own most highly confidential information and shall ensure that its employees who have access to Confidential Information of the other party have signed a non-use and non-disclosure agreement in content similar to the provisions hereof, prior to any disclosure of Confidential Information to such employees.  Neither party shall make any copies of the Confidential Information of the other party unless the same are previously approved in writing by the other party.  Each party shall reproduce the other party’s proprietary rights notices on any such approved copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original.

**9.4. Return of Materials.**  Upon the termination of this Agreement, each party shall deliver to the other party all of such other party’s Confidential Information that such party may have in its possession or control.

If the Software is provided as a service and not delivered to Customer hereunder, Pilosa may immediately deactivate Customer’s account.  Pilosa may keep copies of Customer Data solely to the extent necessary for the performance of its obligations under this Agreement; however, Pilosa will not be obligated to keep Customer Data after the date of termination except as may be specifically set forth in the Order.

### 11. Miscellaneous
**11.1. Nonassignment/Binding Agreement.**  Neither this Agreement nor any rights under this Agreement may be assigned or otherwise transferred by Customer, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, including by way of sale of assets, merger or consolidation, without the prior written consent of Pilosa, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.

No exercise or enforcement by either party of any right or remedy under this Agreement will preclude the enforcement by such party of any other right or remedy under this Agreement or that such party is entitled by law to enforce.

**11.5. Severability.**  If any term, condition, or provision in this Agreement is found to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, the parties shall endeavor in good faith to agree to such amendments that will preserve, as far as possible, the intentions expressed in this Agreement.
